# Syracuse problem

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem or the Collatz problem, is a mathematical problem that has remained unsolved since its inception in the early 20th century. The conjecture is formulated as follows:

Start with any positive integer n.
If n is even, divide it by 2 (n/2).
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (3n + 1).
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you get the number 1.
The Collatz Hypothesis states that starting with any positive integer n, you will always eventually reach the number 1. This statement has not yet been proved or disproved, and it remains an open problem in mathematics.

Although Collatz's hypothesis may seem simple, it is of great interest in the world of mathematics because of its complexity and ambiguity. For some numbers, the sequence of operations can be quite long before the number 1 is reached, but there are no known numbers yet for which it has been proven that they do not satisfy this hypothesis.

The study of the Collatz conjecture remains an active area of mathematical research, and scientists continue to search for deeper properties of this sequence of numbers that might help in its solution.
